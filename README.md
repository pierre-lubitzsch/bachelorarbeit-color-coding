Bachelor thesis about finding simple paths and cycles using color-coding.

Files with prefix "random_orientations" are algorithms using random orientations as a method.
Files with prefix test are files testing the algorithms on a certain graph (or multiple random graphs).
Files of the form x_derandomized.py are the algorithms in file x.py, but derandomized.

In the folder example_graphs there is one file YeastNet.v3.txt containing the edgelist of one real world graph from YeastNet (https://www.inetbio.org/yeastnet/downloadnetwork.php). In the yeast folder inside example_graphs there is another example graph from Pajek datasets (http://vlado.fmf.uni-lj.si/pub/networks/data/bio/Yeast/Yeast.htm).
